The AI engineer successfully initiated development by creating a frontend-only MVP for a Browse Raw Materials web page, utilizing mock data and  for cart persistence to demonstrate core functionality and user experience. This initial phase included implementing the navigation bar, search, filter chips, material cards with Buy Now and Join Group options, and a complete, interactive cart and checkout flow. Upon user confirmation, the focus shifted to backend integration. The AI engineer then developed FastAPI endpoints and MongoDB models for materials and categories, progressively refactoring the frontend to consume these new APIs. Debugging efforts primarily centered on resolving environment variable loading issues in the backend and subsequent cart data fetching errors, culminating in the identification of a MongoDB ObjectId serialization problem as the immediate next task. The work has progressed from a mock frontend to a partially integrated full-stack application, with core listing, search, and filtering functionalities working with real data, but the cart integration still requires a fix.

The goal is to create a minimal Browse Raw Materials web page for street food vendors, acting as an MVP.
**Problem:** Street food vendors need an intuitive platform to browse, filter, and purchase raw materials efficiently.
**MVP Features:**
*   **Top Navbar:** Logo, Browse, Orders, Cart, Logout.
*   **Filters:** Horizontal scrollable chips for categories (Tomatoes, Flour, Oil, Spices).
*   **Material Display:** A clean grid of cards, each showing raw material image, name, price per kg, supplier name, Buy Now, and Join Group buttons.
*   **Search Bar:** Top-level search for materials or suppliers.
*   **Sorting/Filtering:** Options for Price, Verified status, In-Stock status.
*   **Full Cart & Checkout Flow:** Buy Now (individual item), Join Group (minimum group quantity/discount), slide-out shopping cart with quantity controls, and a complete checkout process simulation.
*   **Toast Notifications:** For user actions.
**Styling:**
*   Light theme with clean layout, card shadows, and spacing.
*   Responsive design.
*   Emphasis on interactive animations, depth through layers, bold typography, confident color use, and breaking grid conventions.
**Implementation Status:**
The frontend MVP is complete with mock data and localStorage for cart persistence. Core browsing, searching, and filtering of materials, as well as the complete cart and checkout flow, are fully functional on the frontend. Backend integration has begun, with material and category data now loading from MongoDB via FastAPI. The primary pending issue is a cart data loading error due to a MongoDB ObjectId serialization problem.

<current_work>
The Browse Raw Materials web page for street food vendors has been largely developed into a full-stack application.
**Current State:**
*   **Frontend:** The UI is complete, interactive, and responsive, initially built with mock data. It now attempts to integrate with the backend API.
    *   The Navbar, Search bar, Category filters, and Material cards are present and styled as per requirements.
    *   Material cards display images, names, prices, supplier names, Buy Now, and Join Group buttons.
    *   The application fetches raw materials and categories from the backend.
*   **Backend:** A FastAPI server is running with MongoDB.
    *   Models for materials, categories, cart items, orders, and suppliers have been defined using Pydantic.
    *   API endpoints for fetching materials (), categories (), and basic cart operations () exist.
    *   Initial database seeding is implemented.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Browsing materials and filtering by categories works correctly, loading data from the backend.
    *   The search functionality is implemented on the frontend, filtering the materials fetched from the backend.
    *   The Buy Now and Join Group buttons on the frontend interact with the  hook.
*   **Known Issue:**
    *   A persistent error Error - Failed to load cart data appears in the frontend. Backend logs () indicated an issue with database collection initialization.
    *   This was partially addressed, but the latest backend test summary (Chat Message 72) explicitly states an ObjectId serialization issue related to MongoDB data handling, which is preventing full cart functionality. This suggests that while database connections might be resolved, the way MongoDB  fields are handled in API responses or requests is incorrect.
